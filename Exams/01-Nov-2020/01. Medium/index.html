        <p class="main-p">
          Medium is not like any other platform on the internet. <span>Our sole
            purpose is to help you find compelling ideas, knowledge, and
            perspectives.</span> We don’t serve ads—we serve you, the curious reader who
          loves to learn new things. Medium is home to thousands of independent
          voices, and we combine humans and technology to find the best reading
          for you—and filter out the rest.
