      <b>Elephants</b> are the largest existing land animals. Three living
      <a href="/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> are currently
      recognised: the
      <a href="/wiki/African_bush_elephant" title="African bush elephant"
        >African bush elephant</a
      >, the
      <a href="/wiki/African_forest_elephant" title="African forest elephant"
        >African forest elephant</a
      >, and the
      <a href="/wiki/Asian_elephant" title="Asian elephant">Asian elephant</a>.
      They are an
      <a href="/wiki/Paraphyly" title="Paraphyly">informal grouping</a> within
      the <a href="/wiki/Family_(biology)" title="Family (biology)">family</a>
      <a href="/wiki/Elephantidae" title="Elephantidae">Elephantidae</a> of the
      <a href="/wiki/Order_(biology)" title="Order (biology)">order</a>
      <a href="/wiki/Proboscidea" title="Proboscidea">Proboscidea</a>.
      Elephantidae is the only surviving family of proboscideans; extinct
      members include the
      <a href="/wiki/Mastodon" title="Mastodon">mastodons</a>. Elephantidae also
      contains several extinct groups, including the
      <a href="/wiki/Mammoth" title="Mammoth">mammoths</a> and
      <a href="/wiki/Straight-tusked_elephant" title="Straight-tusked elephant"

      >.
      <a href="/wiki/African_elephant" title="African elephant"
        >African elephants</a
      >
      have larger ears and concave backs, whereas Asian elephants have smaller
      ears, and convex or level backs. Distinctive features of all elephants
      include a long
      <a href="/wiki/Proboscis" title="Proboscis">proboscis</a> called a trunk,
      tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin. The
      trunk is used for breathing, bringing food and water to the mouth, and
      grasping objects. Tusks, which are derived from the incisor teeth, serve
      both as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. The large ear
      flaps assist in maintaining a constant body temperature as well as in
      communication. The <a href="/wiki/Column" title="Column">pillar</a>-like
      legs carry their great weight.

      Elephants are scattered throughout
      <a href="/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa" title="Sub-Saharan Africa"
        >sub-Saharan Africa</a
      >, <a href="/wiki/South_Asia" title="South Asia">South Asia</a>, and
      <a href="/wiki/Southeast_Asia" title="Southeast Asia">Southeast Asia</a>
      and are found in different habitats, including
      <a href="/wiki/Savanna" title="Savanna">savannahs</a>, forests, deserts,
      and <a href="/wiki/Marsh" title="Marsh">marshes</a>. They are
      <a href="/wiki/Herbivorous" class="mw-redirect" title="Herbivorous"
        >herbivorous</a
      >, and they stay near water when it is accessible. They are considered to
      be
      <a href="/wiki/Keystone_species" title="Keystone species"
        >keystone species</a
      >, due to their impact on their environments. Elephants have a

        title="Fission–fusion society"
        >fission–fusion society</a
      >, in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Females
      (cows) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with
      her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups, which do
      not include bulls, are usually led by the oldest cow, known as the
      <a href="/wiki/Matriarchy" title="Matriarchy">matriarch</a>.

    <p>
      Males (bulls) leave their family groups when they reach puberty and may
      live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family
      groups when looking for a mate. They enter a state of increased
      <a href="/wiki/Testosterone" title="Testosterone">testosterone</a> and
      aggression known as <a href="/wiki/Musth" title="Musth">musth</a>, which

      over other males as well as reproductive success. Calves are the centre of
      attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as
      three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They

      African bush elephants and Asian elephants are listed as
      <a href="/wiki/Endangered_species" title="Endangered species"
